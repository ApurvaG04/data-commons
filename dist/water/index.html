<p><strong>i. Premise</strong>- As countries become more urbanized with their economies shifting towards more resource-intensive consumptions, global freshwater usage has increased. However, freshwater, itself, is a scarce resource with only about 3% of our planet’s water being freshwater. The main difference between freshwater and the rest of our world’s water is that freshwater is water containing less than <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/freshwater-lakes-and-rivers-and-water-cycle#overview">1,000mg per liter of dissolved solids (salt)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ii. Breakdown of planet’s water</strong></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>From the image above, we can see the breakdown of distribution for water where 96.5% is ocean water, about 2.5% is freshwater, and 0.9% is other bodies of saline water. Of the percentage of freshwater, it’s further broken down to 68.7% of the 2.5% is glaciers and ice caps, 30.1% is groundwater, and 1.2% is surface/other <a href="https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/EarthsWater-BarChart.png?itok=RuBcM7s8">freshwater</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>iii. Sources of freshwater for human usage</strong>- <strong>NOTE</strong> The majority of freshwater is inaccessible for human consumption as it’s locked away by glaciers and ice caps.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><ins><strong>Groundwater</strong></ins> - Porous materials allow water to seep deep and infiltrate the ground, filling the pores and fractures in layers of underground rock (aquifers).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/chapter/14-3-groundwater-extraction/">Extraction process</a> - pump and treat</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identification of sources</strong>- Using geological surveys, hydrological modeling, and drilling exploratory wells to determine accessibility and viability of aquifers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drilling and pumping</strong>- Wells are drilled into the suitable aquifer with pumping equipment installed into the well as means of extraction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong>- During groundwater extraction process, it’s necessary to monitor and regulate the process to prevent over-extraction and depletion of the aquifer. Methods include measuring water levels in the well, monitoring groundwater quality, and implementing various regulations for long-term use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/groundwater-remediation-technique#:~:text=Commonly%20used%20groundwater%20treatment%20approaches,GAC)%2C%20and%20air%20sparging."><strong>Treatment</strong></a>- Depending on groundwater quality, the water will be treated for possible contaminants. Common treatment methods include air stripping, filtering with granulated activated carbon (GAC), and air sparging</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Air stripping: moving volatile compounds from water into the air where in a tower with permeable material, groundwater flows by gravity downward while a stream of air flows upwards. It’s also possible to bubble pressurized air through contaminated water in a tank, where the air in the tank is then treated by removing pollutants in their vapor phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GAC:contaminated water is pumped through the GACtofilter and trap contaminants in the water</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Air sparging:  pumping air into the subsurface to strip/volatilize contaminants from the groundwater</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Problem/challenges-</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Aquifer depletion: water level in aquifers can be depleted b/c of changes in precipitation and snowmelt patterns, over-extraction of water, and impervious materials on the surface that present precipitation from seeping deep into the ground. This leads to issues of land subsidence or sinkhole formation in areas, thus damaging urban development like buildings and roads.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sustainable/other practices -</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Groundwater Management and Governance: Establishing frameworks for groundwater management from policies to regulations, as well as institutions that monitor and assess the condition of the aquifers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Monitoring and data collection: accurately gathering data on groundwater levels, quality, and recharge rates. Such data is collected and stored as either discrete field-water-level-measurements or as continuous time series data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Groundwater Recharge Projects: Initiatives on enhancing natural groundwater recharge via rainwater harvesting, recharge wells, and managed aquifer recharge (MAR) systems as means of replenishing aquifers for water sustainability</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><ins><strong>What is groundwater recharge?</strong></ins> It’s the process of precipitation that infiltrates into the soil and moves downwards, rather than evaporating, to a depth where water is stored underground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><ins><strong>Managed Aquifer Recharge</strong></ins>: accomplishes groundwater recharge via recharge wells that inject surface water/ treated surface water directly into aquifers. Also, infiltrations are bases where surface water is directed to excavated areas to infiltrate into the ground. Lastly, percolation ponds are another way for groundwater recharge, designing ponds to capture and infiltrate stormwater/surface water that flow downwards into soil substrate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><ins><strong>Surface Water:</strong></ins> Refers to any bodies of water above the ground like lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, creeks, etc</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>uses of surface water include drinking-water and other public uses, irrigation uses, and for use by the thermoelectric-power industry to cool electricity-generating equipment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sustainability: water reuse/ reclaimed water</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The practice of recycling water by treating waste water, like sewage water, of chemicals, solubles, microorganisms, etc before being ready for human usage.</li>

</ol>
<p>vi. Renewable Freshwater Sources: To ensure water sustainability, the rate of water withdrawals will always be less than the rate of freshwater replenishment. In the case of renewable internal freshwater flow, such as internal river flow and groundwater from rainfall, are important in judging a country’s water security and scarcity.</p>

<p>This following data is measured as per capita renewable resource, which takes into account the total quantity of renewable flow and size of the population.</p>
